H.C.BREHRENDTSEN is an experimental math band from Leipzig/Germany. Their genre-fluid music favors surf and nineties rock nostalgia — crushed and grinded by some contemporary composition jamboree — and sprouts out in intricate grooves, eruptive spontaneity and textures ranging from the uplifting to the bizarre.
